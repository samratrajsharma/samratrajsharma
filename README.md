# Samrat Raj Sharma 👋  
### Computer Vision Architect | AI Researcher | LLM & Transformer Systems

I am an **AI Researcher and Computer Vision Architect** with strong foundations in **Deep Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), Transformers, and Software Engineering**.  
My work focuses on building **research-driven AI systems**, spanning **vision-based perception, indirect imaging (NLOS), LLM-powered pipelines, and production-ready ML systems**.

I actively work at the intersection of **theory, implementation, and deployment**, with growing emphasis on **MLOps and LLMOps**.
